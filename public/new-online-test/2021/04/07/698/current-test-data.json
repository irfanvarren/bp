Her mother died soon after her birth, and when her father went to Saskatchewan to assume a business position, she moved in with her grandparents in Cavendish, Prince Edward Island. There she went to school, and later qualified to be a teacher.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Montgomery wrote the Anne books while living in Cavendish and helping her grandmother at the post office. The fIrst of the books, Anne of Green Gables, was published in 1908, and in the next three years she wrote two sequels. Like Montgomery, the heroine of the book is taken in by an elderly couple who live in the fictional town of Avonlea, and Montgomery incorporated many events from her life in Cavendish into the Anne books.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>In 1911, Montgomery married Ewan MacDonald, and the couple soon moved to Ontario, where she wrote many other books. However, it was her first efforts that secured her prominence, and the Anne books are still read all around the world. Her novels have helped create a warm picture of Prince Edward Island's special character. Several movies, a television series, and a musical play have been based on her tales, and today visitors scour the island for locations described in the book.<\/p><\/p>\n",

They know without analysis the difference between a number of objects and a smaller number. In his book The Natural History of Selbourne (1786), the naturalist Gilbert White tells how he surreptitiously removed one egg a day from a plover's nest, and how the mother laid another egg each day to make up for the missing one. He noted that other species of birds ignore the absence of a single egg but abandon their nests if more than one egg has been removed. It has also been noted by naturalists that a certain type of wasp always provides five-never four, never six caterpillars for each of their eggs so that their young have something to eat when the eggs hatch. Research has also shown that both mice and pigeons can be taught to distinguish between odd and even numbers of food pieces.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>These and similar accounts have led some people to infer that creatures other than humans can actually count. They also point to dogs that have been taught to respond to numerical questions with the correct number of barks, or to horses that seem to solve arithmetic problems by stomping their hooves the proper number of times.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Animals respond to quantities only when they are connected to survival as a species-as in the case of the eggs-or survival as individuals-as in the case of food. There is no transfer to other situations or from concrete reality to the abstract notion of numbers. Animals can \"count\" only when the objects are present and only when the numbers involved are small-no more than seven or eight. In lab experiments, animals trained to \"count\" one kind of object were unable to count any other type. The objects, not the numbers, are what interest them. Animals' admittedly remarkable achievements simply do not amount to evidence of counting, nor do they reveal more than innate instincts, reformed by the genes of successive generations, or the results of clever, careful conditioning by trainers.<\/p><\/p>\n",

In his book The Natural History of Selbourne (1786), the naturalist Gilbert White tells how he surreptitiously removed one egg a day from a plover's nest, and how the mother laid another egg each day to make up for the missing one. He noted that other species of birds ignore the absence of a single egg but abandon their nests if more than one egg has been removed. It has also been noted by naturalists that a certain type of wasp always provides five-never four, never six caterpillars for each of their eggs so that their young have something to eat when the eggs hatch.

They know without analysis the difference between a number of objects and a smaller number. In his book The Natural History of Selbourne (1786), the naturalist Gilbert White tells how he surreptitiously removed one egg a day from a plover's nest, and how the mother laid another egg each day to make up for the missing one. He noted that other species of birds ignore the absence of a single egg but abandon their nests if more than one egg has been removed. It has also been noted by naturalists that a certain type of wasp always provides five-never four, never six caterpillars for each of their eggs so that their young have something to eat when the eggs hatch. Research has also shown that both mice and pigeons can be taught to distinguish between odd and even numbers of food pieces.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>These and similar accounts have led some people to infer that creatures other than humans can actually count. They also point to dogs that have been taught to respond to numerical questions with the correct number of barks, or to horses that seem to solve arithmetic problems by stomping their hooves the proper number of times.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Animals respond to quantities only when they are connected to survival as a species-as in the case of the eggs-or survival as individuals-as in the case of food. There is no transfer to other situations or from concrete reality to the abstract notion of numbers. Animals can \"count\" only when the objects are present and only when the numbers involved are small-no more than seven or eight. In lab experiments, animals trained to \"count\" one kind of object were unable to count any other type. The objects, not the numbers, are what interest them. Animals' admittedly remarkable achievements simply do not amount to evidence of counting, nor do they reveal more than innate instincts, reformed by the genes of successive generations, or the results of clever, careful conditioning by trainers.<\/p><\/p>\n",

It made possible the production of low-cost steel and established the foundation of the modern steel industry. In many ways it was responsible for the rapid industrialization of the United States that took place in the formative period of the late 1800's.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>The first Bessemer plant in the United States was built in Wyandotte, Michigan, in 1864, near the end of the Civil War. It was capable of producing only 2 tons of steel ingots at a time. The ingots were rolled into rails-the first steel rails made in the United States. Acceptance of the process was initially slow. By 1870, the annual output of Bessemer steel was a mere 42 thousand tons. Production grew rapidly after about 1875, rising to 1.2 million tons in 1880, when it exceeded that of wrought iron for the first time.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>The rise of the US. steel industry in the last quarter of the19th century was brought about largely by the demand for Bessemer steel rails for the nation's burgeoning rail network. Steel rails were far more durable than those made of iron. Spurred by this demand, the US steel industry became the largest in the world in 1886, when it surpassed that of Great Britain.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>The Bessemer Process was the chief method of making steel until 1907, when it was overtaken by the open-hearth process.

It made possible the production of low-cost steel and established the foundation of the modern steel industry. In many ways it was responsible for the rapid industrialization of the&nbsp;United States that took place in the formative period of the late 1800's.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>The first Bessemer plant in the United States was built in Wyandotte, Michigan, in 1864, near the end of the Civil War. It was capable of producing only 2 tons of steel ingots at a time. The ingots were rolled into rails-the first steel rails made in the United States. Acceptance of the process was initially slow. By 1870, the annual output of Bessemer steel was a mere 42 thousand tons. Production grew rapidly after about 1875, rising to 1.2 million tons in 1880, when it exceeded that of wrought iron for the first time.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>The rise of the US. steel industry in the last quarter of the19th century was brought about largely by the demand for Bessemer steel rails for the nation's burgeoning rail network. Steel rails were far more durable than those made of iron. Spurred by this demand, the US steel industry became the largest in the world in 1886, when it surpassed that of Great Britain.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>The Bessemer Process was the chief method of making steel until 1907, when it was overtaken by the open-hearth process. By the1950's, the Bessemer Process accounted for less than 3% of the total U.S. production.<\/p><\/p>\n",

Many of San Francisco's \"painted ladies\" -its gaudy, nineteenth century Victorian houses-were lost in the disaster. Today, some 14,000 surviving houses have been preserved, particularly in the Cow Hollow, Mission, Pacific Heights, and Alamo Square districts.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Distinguished by their design characteristics, three styles of San Franciscan Victorians can be found today. The Italianate, which flourished in the 1870's, is characterized by a flat roof, slim pillars flanking the front door, and bays with windows that slant inward. The ornamentation of these narrow row houses was patterned after features of the Roman Classical styles. The Stick style, which peaked in popularity during the 1880s, added ornate woodwork outlines to the doors and windows. Other additions included the French cap, gables, and three-sided bays. Designs changed dramatically when the Queen Anne style became the rage in the 1890's. Turrets, towers, steep gabled roofs, and glass art windows distinguished Queen Anne houses from their predecessors.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>In the period after the earthquake, the Victorians came to be regarded as impossibly old-fashioned, but beginning around 1960, owners began peeling off stucco, tearing off false fronts, reapplying custom woodwork, and commissioning multi-hued paint jobs. Before long, many of these houses had been restored to their former splendor.<\/p><\/p>\n",

They are the largest of the mustelids, a group which also includes freshwater otters, weasels, and badgers. They are from four to five feet long, and most weigh from 60 to 85 pounds. Large males may weigh 100 pounds or more.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Unlike most marine mammals, such as seals or dolphins, sea otters lack a layer of blubber, and therefore have to eat up to 30% of their body weight a day in clams, crabs, fish, octopus, squids, and other delicacies to maintain body heat. Their voracious appetites do not create food shortages, though, because they are picky eaters, each animal preferring only a few food types. Thus no single type of food source is exhausted. Sea otters play an important environmental role by protecting forests of seaweed called kelp, which provide shelter and nutrients for many species. Certain sea otters feast on invertebrates like sea urchins and abalones that destroy kelp.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Sea otters eat and sleep while floating on their backs, often on masses of kelp. They seldom come on shore. Sea otters keep warm by means of their luxuriant double-layered fur, the densest among animals. The soft outer fur forms a protective cover that keeps the fur underfur dry. One square inch of underfur contains up to 1 million hairs. Unfortunately, this essential feature almost led to their extinction, as commercial fur hunters drastically reduced their numbers.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Under government protection, the sea otter population has recovered. While elated by the otters return, scientists are concerned about the California sea otter population growth of 5% a year, lagging behind the 18% a year rate among Alaska otters. Sea otters are extremely sensitive to pollution. In 1989 up to 5,000 sea otters perished when the Exxon Valdez spilled oil in Prince William Sound, Alaska.<\/p><\/p>\n",
